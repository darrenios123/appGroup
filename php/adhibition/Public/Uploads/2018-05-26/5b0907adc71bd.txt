Many years ago, there lived a very rich man who wanted to do something for the people of his town. But first he wanted to find out whether they deserved his help. So he placed a very large stone in the center of the main road into town.  Then he hid behind a tree and waited. Soon an old man came along with his cow. 
许多年前，有一个很有钱的人想为他的乡亲做一些事。但是，首先他想知道他们是否值得他的帮助。于，他把一个非常大的石头放在镇上主要道路的中心。然后，他躲在了一棵树，等待着。很快，一个老人牵着牛走来。
"Who put this stone in the center of the road?" said the old man, but he did not try to remove the stone. Instead, with some difficulty he passed around the stone and continued on his way. Another man came along and did the same thing; then another came, and another. All of them complained about the stone in the center of the road, but not one of them tried to remove it. Late in the afternoon, a young man came along. He saw the stone and said, "The night will be very dark. Some neighbor will come along later in the dark and will fall against the stone. " 
“谁把石头放在路中心了？ ”老人说，但他没有搬开石头。相反，费了点劲，他绕过石头，继续赶路。另一个人来了，做了同样的事情;然后来了一个又一个。所有这些人都抱怨石头挡在路中间，但是没有一个人试图将其搬走。黄昏时，一个年轻人来了。他看到了石头并且说， “晚上是很黑的。天黑时，邻居走来时，会被石头绊倒的。 ” 
The young man then began to move the stone. He pushed and pulled with all his strength to move it to one side. But imagine his surprise when under the stone he found a bag full of money and this message: "This money is for the thoughtful person who removes this stone from the road. That person deserves help." 
这个年轻人开始把石头搬走。他用劲所有力量连推带拉把石头推倒一边去。而让他吃惊的是，他在石头下发现一个装满金钱的袋子和这条讯息：“这钱是给从这条路上搬走这块石头的深思熟虑的人。这个人值得帮助。”
