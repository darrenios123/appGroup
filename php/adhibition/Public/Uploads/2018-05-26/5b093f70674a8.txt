这是每个孩子最恐怖的噩梦，而六岁的杰登·海耶斯却亲身经历了两次。第一次是在他四岁的时候，他失去了自己的爸爸，随后，他的妈妈于上个月在睡梦中猝死。
It is every kid's worst nightmare and six-year-old Jaden Hayes has lived it -- twice. First he lost his dad when he was four and then last month his mom died unexpectedly in her sleep.

杰登说道：“我再三尝试让她醒过来，但是没有用。”
"I tried and I tried and I tried to get her awake -- I couldn't," said Jaden.
杰登的伤心可想而知。
Jaden is understandably heartbroken.
但是他将悲痛开始向好的方向转变。他再也不想看到每个人总是一脸惆怅了，他把这个想法先告诉了他的姨妈（也是他现在的监护人）芭芭拉·迪克拉。他已经有了改变这种情况的计划。
But there's another side to his grief. A side he first made public a few weeks ago when he told his aunt, and now guardian, Barbara DiCola, that he was sick and tired of seeing everyone sad all the time. And he had a plan to fix it.
“这是一个开头，”芭芭拉说道。“这是此次冒险的开始。”
"And that was the beginning of it," said Barbara. "That's where the adventure began."
杰登要求他的姑姑芭芭拉给他买一些小玩具，并且将他带到他居住地附近的市中心乔治亚州萨凡纳，这样他就可以把玩具发放出去。


Jaden asked his aunt Barbara to buy a bunch of little toys and bring him to downtown Savannah, Georgia near where he lives, so he could give them away.

“我正在努力让每个人微笑，”乔登说道。
"I'm trying to make people smile," said Jaden.
乔登以没有笑的人为目标，随后改变他们的这一天。他现在已经去了四个不同的场合，并且都是大功告成。即便有时他没有得到他想要的反应。
Jaden targets people who aren't already smiling and then turns their day around. He's gone out on four different occasions now and he is always successful. Even if sometimes he doesn't get exactly the reaction he was hoping for.
这对于一些人而言简直是难以拒绝的，一个六岁的孤儿不求回报地分发他的玩具，只是想要个微笑。
It is just so overwhelming to some people that a six-year-old orphan would give away a toy -- expecting nothing in return -- except a smile.
“我的目标是33000人，”乔登说道。当被问及他是否能够完成这个目标时，他说道：“我认为我可以。”
"I'm counting on it to be 33,000," said Jaden. When asked if he thinks he can make that goal, he answered: "I think I can."
