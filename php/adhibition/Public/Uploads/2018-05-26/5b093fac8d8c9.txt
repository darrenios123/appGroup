不要尝试着让自己快乐--那样只会让你痛苦。
Don't try and be happy - it will only make you sad.

一项最新研究表明，强颜欢笑只会让你的抑郁更加严重。
Desperately trying to keep a smile on your face will only make your depression worse, a new study suggests.
多年来，保持欢乐已经成为了许多人的唯一目标，但是接受你的悲伤或许更加有益。
Feeling content has become the sole goal for many in recent years, but embracing your sadness may be more beneficial.
据墨尔本大学的研究人员表示，社会对悲伤的彻底回避，可能会对忧郁患者造成伤害。
University of Melbourne researchers said that society's downright shunning of being sad could be harmful for sufferers of the blues.
参与该研究的一名心理学家布鲁克·巴斯蒂安表示：“在幸福感越高的国家，抑郁症也越严重。”

Dr Brock Bastian, a psychologist behind the study, said: 'Depression rates are higher in countries that place a premium on happiness.'

“快乐不再仅仅只是幸福生活的副产品，而已经成为了一个目标。这加强了这一信息--我们应该增强我们的积极情绪，避免消极情绪。”
'Rather than being the by-product of a life well-lived, feeling happy has become a goal in itself. This reinforces the message that we should aim to maximise our positive emotions and avoid our negative ones'
巴斯蒂安博士暗示，如果想要有效控制这种失调，那么社会就应该改变对抑郁的态度。
Society needs to change its attitude on depression if the disorder is to be tackled effectively, Dr Bastian hinted.
他还表示，由于社交媒体被用来庆祝成功，因此人们已经非常习惯于不表现出自己脆弱的一面。
He added that people have become so used to not showing signs of vulnerability due to social media being used to celebrate achievements.
该研究发表在《抑郁与焦虑》杂志上，研究人员共对112名抑郁患者进行了评估。每个志愿者都被要求评估他们的抑郁症状以及他们想要快乐所面临的压力。追踪调查时间历时一个月。
For the study published in the journal Depression and Anxiety, the researchers assessed 112 depressed patients. Each volunteer was asked to rate their symptoms of the blues and how much pressure they faced to be happy. They were tracked over a period of one month.
