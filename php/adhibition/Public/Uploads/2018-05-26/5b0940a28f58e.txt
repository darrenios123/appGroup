The billionaire CEO returned to Harvard to receive an honorary degree - 13 years after he famously dropped out of the Ivy League school to focus on Facebook.
近日，这位亿万富翁的CEO回到哈佛领取了一份荣誉学位--而今据他从哈佛辍学创办Facebook已经过去了13年。
'Change starts local. Even global changes start small - with people like us,' the 33-year-old told the crowd of graduates.
33岁的扎克伯格对毕业生们说道：“改变往往从细微处开始，即使全球性的变革也是从小事情开始--从我们这些人开始。”
'Every generation expands the circle of people we consider 'one of us.' And in our generation, that now includes the whole world. ...But we live in an unstable time.'
“每一代人都会扩大'自己人'的圈子。而到了我们这一代，全世界都是'自己人'。但是我们身处一个很不稳定的时代。”
'There are people left behind by globalization across the whole world. And it's tough to care about people in other places when we don't first feel good about our lives here at home.'
“整个世界都有被全球化丢下的人。当我们自己的生活都不够好时，我们很难再去关心别人。”
Zuckerberg, now the youngest commencement speaker in Harvard's history, started off reliving some of his college memories.
随后扎克伯格（现在他是哈佛史上最年轻的毕业演讲者）重温了自己的一些大学回忆。
