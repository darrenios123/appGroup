问题来了，普拉蒂尼是如何在抽签上做手脚的呢？

1998年世界杯规则规定，ADEH四个小组在上半区，BCFG在下半区，原本所有种子球队所在的小组应该是随机抽取，ESPN推测，普拉蒂尼应该是在世界杯抽签前国际足联召开的会议上，向时任FIFA组委会主席约翰松和时任国际足联主席阿维兰热施加了压力，最终内定巴西分在A组，法国则在C组，这样只要两队都拿到小组第一，决赛前就不会相遇。

事实上，法国并不是唯一获利的东道主，“其他世界杯东道主就没这么干吗”，普拉蒂尼的这一反问意味深长。

抽签上的“小手脚”只是东道主的一种福利，1994年世界杯，美国队就根据各个种子队在各座城市的受欢迎程度而决定他们抽到哪个小组；2006年德国世界杯，德国和卫冕冠军巴西也不会在决赛前相遇。而且，1998年法国最终得以在决赛碰见巴西，也全靠两队的实力，2002年世界杯，东道主日本分在D组，法国则在A组，两队也不会在决赛前相遇，但法国队小组垫底出局。

当然那届世界杯，日本队在争取福利方面，可没有另一个东道主韩国来得积极……
The question is, how did platini juggle the draw?
Rules, the 1998 World Cup soon four groups in sits, BCFG in half, all the seeds team originally should be random, ESPN speculation, platini should be before the World Cup draw FIFA meeting, to the organizing committee at the FIFA President johansson, and then to pressure the FIFA President Mr Havelange, eventually default points in group A, Brazil, France, in group C, such as long as the two teams to get the team first, before the final will not meet.
In fact, France is not the only host to make a profit. "the other World Cup hosts don't do that," platini said in a significant way.
The draw was a boon for the host nation, which decided which team to draw at the 1994 World Cup based on the popularity of the seed teams in each city.Germany and defending champion Brazil will not meet before the 2006 World Cup in Germany.And, in 1998, France was eventually meet Brazil in the final, also depends on the strength of the two teams, the 2002 World Cup, the host Japan points in group D, France is in group A, the two teams will not meet in the final, but the French team bottom out.
Of course, in that World Cup, the Japanese team was not as active as the other host country, South Korea, in terms of welfare
