The quadrennial World Cup is one of the top competitions in international football. In order to become the leading role in the World Cup, all the national teams are just like the eight immortals crossing the sea.Strong teams can get out of the game on their own, and a few of the weaker national teams are thinking outside the game.And that's the story I'm going to tell.
Time was set back to 3 September 1989 at the maracana stadium in Brazil.World Cup qualifying match in South America area last round of Brazil and Chile looming, the game will directly decide an entry quota of 1990 World Cup in Italy, Brazil only draw progress, and they must win.
In the 49th minute, the stalemate was broken, the advantage of home and strength were better, and Brazil took the lead.Since then, Brazil has kept a firm grip on the game, and Chile has seen no sign of winning back.The Brazilian fans began to get excited in the stands, some radical fans constantly throw all sorts of sundry within admission, a female fans even dropped a YanHuaDan, and it happened to fall in the Chile goalkeeper rojas.What happened next shocked everyone. The smoke cleared away, rojas covered his face with his hand and fell to the ground in pain.Chile's medical staff rushed in, rojas was carried off by his team-mates, and then the team called off the game for safety reasons.The Chilean football association immediately called for the result to be cancelled and the neutral venue to be replayed.
But not long after, the event turned around 180 degrees.Rojas' wounds on his face were clearly cuts rather than burns, according to the FIFA investigation team.Eventually, under pressure, rojas himself uncovered his "great deception".Aware of their team as Brazil, so before the game, rojas hid a knife in his left hand set, the purpose is to create chaos in the result of the match against his side, let the result is invalid.Rojas felt the opportunity when the flamethrower appeared beside him.He took out his knife and cut his face with his own hands as the smoke obscured his vision.
The whole world was shocked by rojas's scheme when the truth came out.But his cleverness didn't really help the team, and rojas was eventually banned for life by FIFA, forcing him to retire at the golden age of 32 and leave his beloved football field ahead of time.And Chile were not spared, not only on the spot was directly judged negative, but also was banned from the 1994 World Cup, it is said that "stealing the chicken is not against eating the rice".
