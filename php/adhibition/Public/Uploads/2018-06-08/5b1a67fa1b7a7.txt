In 2006, he was a "kid," in 2010, he still "didn't have enough experience," in 2014, he won a golden globe, and his dream of winning was buried by an eternal rival.
Messi must win the World Cup in view of the major role played by Mario alberto kempis in 78 years, especially maradona in 86.
This is messi's story so far, told by those present at the time.
2006
Khalid salorio played a vital role in messi's development.
"He made a very lucky decision," said salorio. "he played football and scored in his 18th World Cup debut.He played 16 minutes against Serbia and Montenegro, making him the youngest player in Argentina's World Cup history.But the World Cup is more like a cruel learning process than a fairy tale.Can he give all the answers as he does now?No, because Argentina had everything, at that age, what he has done is just a little bit of contribution, he always wants to play, this is very bad, in my view, he can give the team of 15 to 20 minutes, during this period, he can let the opponent to lose balance, he really did a good job, the problem is that at that age, you must insist on 90 minutes, I think he can't do.In his 20s, he was well above that level, but he lacked something for a high-level player who had to play in the time the team needed.I don't think he understands that.
Messi started against Holland.I told him, 'you created four chances, but you didn't score.A goal is worth one point, not five. It doesn't matter if you take the ball to the penalty area four or five times or hit it on the goal line.We teach him every day and we are teaching a young man how to play high class football.Salorio recalled his advice to messi.
In the locker room, he spoke very little, and there were long guys around him to protect him.He knows how to leave a mark on the court, when he against Mexico in the 84th minute substitute, after one of his goals were ignored, gonzalo Ferdinand insists that if with the help of a VAR, messi the ball into the.
Despite his impressive performance, he was left on the bench by coach Peter perkman in Argentina's quarter-finals against Germany.Gonzalo Leo messi put forward on the explain the decision of the board, said: "there are 25 minutes, peck, said Germany equalised the only way is to hit a lob, so he replaced Juan Roman riquelme, let cambiasso prevented the striker 4, then some make imbalances happened, were injured in the state of Dan xie.With 12 minutes left, he made the decision in 10 seconds to make cruz a forward who could defend in both situations.With 10 minutes to go, they equalised, and under the current rules we could have a fourth substitution in overtime, and if we had messi on the pitch, it would have been different."

Salorio believes they changed messi that summer.This is the most useful thing because when you play football, Argentina has a bad father.Messi came to me with the ease that they taught him, and we taught him the meaning of playing in Argentina.He explained what bad dad meant :" my father is cruel. My opponent is my colleague, not my enemy.Here, football is life.If you are generous in your life, you are generous on the court, if you are stingy, especially on the court.To us, victory is an important part of life.Messi has to understand that. We've taught him to be hungry.We know you're going to die on the court.You can't understand it until you feel it.The sporting director of Barcelona asked us what we had done to him to make a difference.We simply let him know, in Argentina, you live in a different way in football, in here, if you don't win, they will kill you, in Spain, you will be relatively easier.We believe that the next World Cup will be messi's take-off you see now.Our messi just started, it's just the beginning.
2010
Messi won the first of his five golden globe awards at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, and his performance in Barcelona ensured high expectations.The discovery of a new maradona in Argentina will only add to the pressure, and he is often compared to maradona.
Fernando sinolini was maradona's fitness coach from 1983 to 1994 and his coach in South Africa.It was there that maradona worked closely with messi."Maradona has a good relationship with him, like a professor and a student," he said.They admire each other, as if they look in the mirror, he sees a sure that he will be his successor, and messi made a maradona had done.Once he was in the area, he had an amazing concentration, and there was nothing to make him happier than an amazing goal.He was not as enthusiastic as maradona, but it was interesting to see him swimming so comfortably in the rough water.He has achieved a lot in the four years between his two world cups, but he remains silent in the dressing room.I think he is the weirdest of all the best players in football history because he does look different.Indeed, people don't usually show their rarest emotions, and on the outside, he looks like a quiet lake, perhaps with a boiling volcano.The volcano, however, never really erupted. Surrounded by tevez, iguain, di maria and veron, messi scored many goals, but he never lost himself.He didn't score anything in South Africa, but I believe he had a chance to score, I think between six and eight, but for different reasons they didn't score.
Argentina easily advanced through a group that included Nigeria, South Korea and Greece, and eliminated familiar rivals Mexico and Germany.Unfortunately, it was eliminated by Germany again.A large part of the team is very young, and it is a very big obstacle against a strong team with so much experience like Germany in the World Cup.Maradona's young, attacking team was ruthlessly beaten by joachim loew's Germany during the World Cup.Messi's story is not complete.
The World Cup in South Africa was another step up the ladder for messi, who eventually became one of the best players of all time.He doesn't have enough experience, like maradona did at the 1982 World Cup.We always look forward to some of his magic, but we should know the time is not yet ripe.
2014
Lionel messi has been a lot of people think is the best player in the history, it was his from South Africa to Brazil on the club level between progress and win the World Cup will shift the sceptics.
West Gordon said, "" we know that for massey and other members of the team, their World Cup will be the next World Cup in 2014, because they will be four years old at that time, have more valuable experience".
If it were messi's World Cup, he would be the silent leader.
"He doesn't like to be in public, he's shy, he takes a lot of pictures, he signs a lot of autographs, I think it's embarrassing for him," said Argentine coach julien camino.But he is a great player on the pitch, he is always involved, he is the best player in the world, he can use many ways to win the game, as we saw in 2014, he won the game can use the free kick."
In against bosnia and herzegovina, he single-handedly made a wonderful game alone, he used a miraculous goal in the last minute broke the hearts of the men of Iran, and in the uphill battle with Nigeria, scoring two goals.Argentina did not look entirely convincing, but messi did.The captain led the others to his level."Who wouldn't listen to the best players in the world?Of course, Argentina must too, because they have the best players in the world.They have to give him everything, the best course, the best preparation, the best clothes, so that the best player in the world and the other players are very calm, they only need to consider is that game."
In 2006, his lack of experience limited his playing time.In 2010, he played every minute, but struggled with an unbalanced team.In 2014, he was the leader in the game and the team played to his advantage."We kicked him out on the right because when he got into the inside, his whole attacking opportunity opened up and he could shoot or assist the forward.Alejandro has played one or two more forwards so the opposition doesn't have to defend messi more and he can play more freely on the right."Said camino.
However, he looks more restricted in the knockout rounds, as does Argentina.Argentina narrowly beat Switzerland 1-0 in overtime in the quarter-finals, with messi helping di maria in the 118th minute.In the quarter-finals, gonzalo higuain broke the deadlock with just eight minutes to go and Argentina advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Cup by beating Belgium 1-0.Argentina beat Holland 4-2 on penalties in game 2 of the semi-final.The two sides were tied in a 120-minute draw, with romero saving the penalties from veral and sneijder.It wasn't beautiful, but Argentina entered the final and messi was on the verge of immortality."My strongest memory is that when we beat Holland, you could see messi yelling and crying," camino said.That's when you realize what Argentina's jersey means to these players.The idea has been lingering in my mind, because we have so many people hugging each other in the dressing room, Shouting they want to represent Argentina play a World Cup final, this is what they have been longing for."
However, in the final, we lost to Germany again.
Gonzalo higuain made a notorious mistake early in the game, but messi went all out in the second half.The Argentine players gathered together.Instead of messi, fans at home took a picture of mascherano and called in the troops.Camino said: "no, no, this picture has nothing to do with his performances in front of the class, we are working at the final, we take a rest for a moment, he is very focused, but that doesn't mean he is not a leader, even if he was not involved in the conversation.Mascherano and messi, they are just two different leaders.Mascherano may talk more, but messi is a very good leader.From that day on, however, messi's most famous photograph, perhaps the most famous photograph ever taken.Messi showed himself what could have happened when Mario goetze scored the winning goal and the German players won the tournament.He stood a few yards away, staring blankly at the World Cup, his face haunting his mind."After the defeat, he was very sad," camino recalled. "he proved that he could have won the World Cup.It was one of the best games in Argentina, we had three chances to score and Germany only had one.It's only a small distance away from us.It's not just messi.All our players and staff, involuntarily peeking at the trophy......There it is, and we almost won the trophy. "will this picture define messi's World Cup legacy, even his entire career?The story continues in Russia
