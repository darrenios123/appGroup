更神奇的事情发生在一周之后。泰晤士河驳船厂的工人科贝特带着他的小狗皮克斯在早上外出闲逛，皮克斯在一栅栏处嗅来嗅去，不肯离开，好奇的科贝特走过去查看究竟是什么如此吸引皮克斯。

科贝特在那里发现了一个纸包，打开一看把他自己也吓了一大跳，这不就是失窃的雷米特杯嘛！

科贝特赶忙将雷米特杯交给了此时正举足无措的英足总，并且领到了5000英镑的奖赏，而他的小狗也得到了一块肉骨头作为奖励。
时任英足总主席米尔斯担心金杯再生意外，于是偷偷让伦敦金匠制作了一个与雷米特杯一模一样的奖杯，并将这个赝品拿出去继续展览，而将真正的金杯藏在自己床下。这个赝品在于1997年的一场拍卖会中以254,500英镑售出给国际足联。
雷米特杯盗窃案事发之后，英国人遭到巴西人的无情讥讽。巴西体育协会的一名官员称：“这样可耻的盗窃永远不会在巴西发生。巴西的小偷也喜欢足球，但绝对不会有如此亵渎神圣的罪过。”
The more amazing thing happened a week later.Thames river barges factory workers families and Bert took his dog pixar hang out in the morning, pixar is sniffing at a fence, refused to leave, the curious corbett went over to see what is so appealing to pixar.

Then the fa chairman mills worry jinbei regeneration accident, then secretly make London goldsmiths made a is the same as with the Jules rimet trophy cup, and will continue to show this fake out, to hide the real gold cup in his bed.The fake was sold to FIFA for 254,500 pounds at an auction in 1997.
