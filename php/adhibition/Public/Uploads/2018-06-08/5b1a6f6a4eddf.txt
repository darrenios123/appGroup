但令人啼笑皆非的是，雷米特杯最后却葬送在了巴西人手中。

雷米特杯巴西再度失窃 至今下落不明

1983年，雷米特杯再度离奇失踪。当时巴西足协制造了一个复制品用于展览，真的雷米特杯则被保存在足协总部九层的保险柜中。1983年12月19日，一个叫Ayres的人（他之前去过巴西足协主席的办公室欣赏奖杯）以及两个同伙潜入了九楼的办公室，他们只用了很短的时间就搞定了防盗装置，偷走了雷米特杯。

此后球王贝利等都曾公开呼吁希望盗窃者能够物归原主，“为了巴西足球的灵魂而归还金杯。”但是真正的雷米特杯并没有重见天日，有传言称雷米特杯已经被盗贼重炉，金杯至今下落不明。

如今的世界杯冠军奖杯，又被称作大力神杯，从1974年开始使用，大力神杯的底座上共可刻下1974年至2038年十七届世界杯冠军的国家名称，但在2038年的世界杯结束之后，大力神杯是否将退役尚不清楚
